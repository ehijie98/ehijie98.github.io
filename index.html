        <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
        <p>Semantic essential means bringing meaning into the code that we write. With Semantic HTML, 
            you are introducing elements that tell developers and browsers exactly what it does and what 
            content belongs in it. <br> Semantic HTML introduces elements that can tell developers exactly 
            what the element does or where itâ€™s placed based on the name of that element. Some of these 
            elements are <span class="element">&lt;header&gt;</span>, <span class="element">&lt;nav&gt;</span>, 
            <span class="element">&lt;main&gt;</span>, and <span class="element">&lt;footer&gt;</span>
        </p>

                        &lt;article&gt;</span> can be used to write independent content for that theme.
